Hello! Welcome to my project where I dig deeper into the sales data of a store selling clothing, footwear, outerwear and fashion accessories across 50 different locations. 
In this project, we harness the capabilities of powerful Python libraries, particularly Pandas for data manipulation and organization while 
visualizing insightful narratives using visualization libraries, prominently Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly. 
By doing so we not only gain a comprehensive understanding of the shopping behaviour of customers but 
also provide a solid foundation for informed decision-making to enhance overall customer experiences and 
optimize operational strategies.

The analysis was aimed at answering 15 business questions as follows:-
1. What is the proportion of Male and Female customers visiting the store?
2.  What is the age distribution of the customers visiting the store? 
3. Maximum number of customers visiting the store belong to which age group?
4. Rank the types of products sold based on the number of items sold for each type. (Gender Wise)
5. what are the sales for each type of product sold?
6. Which are the most Popular sizes among each type of item sold? 7. which are the most popular items among the customers?
8. Which are the most popular colours among each type of customer? (Gender Wise)
9. Plot the customer satisfaction trend w.r.t each type of item sold. 10. Which are the Best 10 Performing stores?
11. Which are the 10 worst-performing stores?
12. what proportion of customers are subscribers? (Gender Wise) 13. Which Payment method is preferred by the customers?
14. plot the Shopping frequency trends by both genders.
15. How do seasonal differences affect the preferred shipping type by customers?
